# COVID-19 Segmentation on 3D CT Volumes via MIScnn using the U-Net Architecture

Description blabla / Abstract

This work does NOT claim clinical performance in any means and underly purely educational purposes.

## Reproducibility

**Requirements:**
- Ubuntu 18.04
- Python 3.6
- NVIDIA QUADRO RTX 6000 or a GPU with equivalent performance

**Step-by-Step workflow:**

Move working directory into repository.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/muellerdo/covid19.MIScnn.git
cd covid19.MIScnn/
```

Run blabla

```sh
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Run blabla

```sh
python3 scripts/download_data.py
```

## Materials

Short description of data set / data set exploration  
Source etc, credits

## Methods

MIScnn -> link to official repo  
U-Net architecture  
heavy data augmentation

## Results & Discussion

add plot  
small data set (only 20 samples) -> resulting interpretation is heavily biased

Limited data -> what is currently possible in medical image segmentation of COVID-19.  
This work does NOT claim clinical performance in any means and underly purely educational purposes.
